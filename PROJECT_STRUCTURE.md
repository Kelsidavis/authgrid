## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Identity Handles
Email-like identifiers (e.g., `n5xtc4q3f3@authgrid.net`) that contain no PII but work across any service.

### Challenge-Response Authentication
Users prove they own a private key by signing a random challenge, without ever revealing the key.

### Federation
Anyone can run an Authgrid node (like email servers). Nodes interoperate using DNS discovery.

### WebAuthn
Browser standard for hardware-backed cryptographic keys, unlocked by biometrics.

### Open Protocol
Authgrid is a protocol, not just a product. Designed to become an open standard like email or OAuth.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Core API | Go or Rust |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Redis |
| Client SDK | JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin |
| Cryptography | Ed25519, WebAuthn |
| Transport | HTTPS/JSON REST |
| Deployment | Docker, Kubernetes |

## 🚀 Current Status

**Status:** Planning & Documentation Phase

**Next Steps:**
1. Choose tech stack (Go vs. Rust, PostgreSQL vs. Redis)
2. Set up project repository and CI/CD
3. Build Phase 0: Core API (Weeks 1-2)
4. Build Phase 1: Client SDK (Weeks 2-3)
5. Launch MVP (Week 4)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed timeline.

## 💡 Why This Approach?

### Documentation-First Development

We're starting with comprehensive documentation because:

1. **Clarity of vision** — Forces us to think through the entire system
2. **Team alignment** — Everyone understands the goal before writing code
3. **Easier fundraising** — Investors can see the full picture
4. **Community building** — Early contributors know what we're building
5. **Better architecture** — Designing on paper before coding prevents mistakes

### Open From Day One

Authgrid is designed to be an open protocol, so we're:

- Open sourcing all core code (MIT license)
- Publishing specifications early
- Building for federation from the start
- Encouraging third-party implementations

This creates network effects and prevents vendor lock-in.
