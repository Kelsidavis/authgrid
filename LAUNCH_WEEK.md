## 📝 Launch Templates

### Product Hunt Submission

**Name:** Authgrid

**Tagline:** Passwordless authentication in 5 minutes

**Description:**
```
Authgrid is an open-source passwordless authentication system that replaces passwords with cryptographic keys.

Instead of passwords, users get a unique handle (like email) and authenticate using keys stored securely on their device.

🔑 Key Features:
• No passwords to forget or leak
• Self-owned identity handles (@authgrid.net)
• Works across any service
• Open source & self-hostable
• Free tier forever

🚀 Getting Started:
Integration takes < 5 minutes. Check out our demo at authgrid.org

💰 Pricing:
• Free: Self-hosted, unlimited users
• $29/mo: Managed hosting (we handle DevOps)
• Open source (MIT license)

Built for developers who are tired of Auth0's pricing and complexity.
```

**First Comment (Post immediately after launching):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Kelsi, creator of Authgrid.

I built this because I was frustrated with:
- Auth0 charging $25+/month for basic auth
- Users forgetting passwords and requesting resets
- Password database leaks making headlines

Authgrid is different:
✓ No passwords = no password problems
✓ Free self-hosted option (like email servers)
✓ Open source - no vendor lock-in
✓ Simple pricing ($29/mo managed vs Auth0's $25+)

Try the demo: [link]
GitHub: github.com/Kelsidavis/authgrid

Happy to answer any questions! What are your biggest auth pain points?

### Show HN Post

**Title:**
```
Show HN: Authgrid – Passwordless auth in 5 minutes (open source)
```

**Post:**
```
Hey HN!

I built Authgrid - an open-source alternative to Auth0 that uses cryptographic keys instead of passwords.

Demo: https://authgrid.org
GitHub: https://github.com/Kelsidavis/authgrid

**How it works:**
1. User gets a handle (like email): user@authgrid.net
2. Device generates keypair, private key never leaves device
3. Auth happens via challenge-response (like SSH)
4. No passwords, no password resets, no database leaks

**Why I built this:**
- Auth0 is expensive ($25-1,000/mo)
- WebAuthn is too complex for most developers
- Passwords are fundamentally broken (leaks, resets, 2FA)

**Features:**
- Open source (MIT)
- Self-hostable for free
- Managed option: $29/mo
- 5-minute integration
- Works across any service (federated)

**Stack:**
- Go API (Ed25519 signatures)
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript SDK (WebCrypto)
- Deployed on Fly.io ($0 hosting)

This is my first launch. I'd love feedback on:
1. Is the developer experience simple enough?
2. Would you use this over Auth0/Firebase?
3. What features are missing?

GitHub has full docs and examples. Happy to answer questions!
```

**Follow-up Comments (respond to questions):**
- Be helpful, not defensive
- Thank everyone for feedback
- Fix issues people find IMMEDIATELY
- Share updates in comments

### Twitter/X Launch Thread

**Tweet 1:**
```
🚀 Launching Authgrid today!

Passwordless authentication for developers who are tired of Auth0's pricing and complexity.

✓ Open source
✓ Self-hostable (free)
✓ 5-minute setup
✓ No passwords = no password leaks

Try it: [link]

🧵 Thread below ↓
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Why build another auth system?

I was paying Auth0 $300/month for 50K users.

Then I realized: SSH has been using keypairs for 30 years. Why not auth?

Authgrid brings SSH's security model to web/mobile apps.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
How it works:

1. User registers → gets handle (like email)
2. Device generates Ed25519 keypair
3. Private key stored in browser/phone (never sent to server)
4. Auth via challenge-response

Same security as SSH. No passwords to leak.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Pricing:

• Free: Self-hosted, unlimited users
• $29/mo: Managed hosting
• $99/mo: Pro features (SSO, white-label)

vs Auth0:
• $25/mo (limited)
• $240/mo (standard)
• Huge enterprise prices

Open source = no vendor lock-in 🔓
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Try the demo: [link]
Read the code: [github link]

Built with:
• Go + PostgreSQL
• JavaScript SDK
• Deployed on Fly.io (free tier)

Takes 5 minutes to integrate.

Feedback welcome! What auth problems do you face?
```

## 🎬 Demo Video Script (2 minutes)

**[00:00-00:15] Hook**
"Passwords suck. They get leaked, forgotten, and reset constantly. What if we could eliminate them entirely?"

**[00:15-00:30] Problem**
"Auth0 charges $300/month for 50K users. Firebase locks you in. Building from scratch takes weeks."

**[00:30-00:45] Solution**
"Meet Authgrid - passwordless auth in 5 minutes. It's open source, self-hostable, and starts at $0."

**[00:45-01:15] Demo**
[Screen recording]
- Visit demo site
- Click "Register" (2 seconds)
- Get handle: user@authgrid.net
- Click "Login" (2 seconds)
- Show authenticated state

**[01:15-01:45] How It Works**
"Under the hood, it's simple:
1. Device generates keypair
2. Server sends challenge
3. Device signs challenge
4. Server verifies signature

Same tech as SSH, but for web apps."

**[01:45-02:00] Call to Action**
"Try the demo at authgrid.org
Start free, scale when ready.

## 💼 Stripe Integration (Next Step)

After launch, add actual Stripe checkout:

1. Get Stripe API keys
2. Add checkout endpoint to API
3. Update pricing page JavaScript
4. Test with Stripe test mode
5. Go live

For now, pricing page collects emails → you can manually onboard first customers.

## 🎯 Week 2 Goals

**If you got your first customer:**
- Keep shipping features they request
- Ask for testimonial/case study
- Get 5 more customers
- Write "We got our first customer" post

**If you didn't:**
- Don't panic, this is normal
- Focus on SEO content
- Do direct outreach (10 emails/day)
- Find your specific niche

Remember: **Most "overnight successes" took years.**

Your goal this week: Prove ONE person values this enough to pay $29.

Everything else is noise.

Let's go! 🚀
